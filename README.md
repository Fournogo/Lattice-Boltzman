# Lattice-Boltzman
Simulates the flow of fluid over a cylinder using the Lattice Boltzman method. Allows you to see vortex shedding in action.

The lattice boltzman method is essentially magic that works for a fairly narrow set of boundary conditions but produces a convincing simulation
with details you would often need to use a Navier-Stokes simulation to see.
